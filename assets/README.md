# assets folder

This folder stores textures (sprites) used in the project.

Should only contains textures (sprites) that are used in the project, or could be used later.
Full packs or backups should be stored in _raw folder.
Due to hotloading code limitation, the textures (sprites) could not be put in the assets folder.
